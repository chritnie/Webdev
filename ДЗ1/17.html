<h1>21 Savage - Spiral</h1>
<hr>
<p>Everything I do, I be ten steps ahead (Ten)
My youngin got them bodies, he still pissin the bed(Spend)
Keep the code of silence, don't repeat what I said (21)
Keep all the baloney, I just came for the bread (On God)
My hood known for wildin' and I don't promote the violence
I done been through all the trials and tribulations, now I'm smilin' (21)
Say he wanted smoke, we at the table doin' the plottin'
We gon' slide, wet your shit up, make it home 'fore you h–µar a siren (Big facts)</p>
